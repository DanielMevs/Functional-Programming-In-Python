things filter can help use with
--------------------------------

the next important built-in list funcition in python is called filter
filter is used when you want to find all the elements in a list or
some other type of iterable that fit some type of criteria.

Ex1: we have a list of numbers and we want to get all the numbers from
it taht are even

Ex2: we have a list of employee data and we want to find the employees 
from this list that make more than a certain amount per year

Filter is very similar to  map. 
We call it by passing it both a function and an iterable, such as a 
list, tuple or set. 
The main difference between filter and map, however, is the purpose of the
function that we pass into it. 
In map we pass in a function that returns a value for each element in an 
array.

filter(some_function, my_list)

For filter, we pass in a function that returns either true or false for each
element.
If the function that we pass returns true for a given element then that 
element is included in the final result, otherwise it's left out.
