"Lambdas In Python"
One-line, unnamed functions that can be defined inside larger exressions
Syntax: The keyword lambda followed by some number of arguments separated
by commas without parentheses and then a colon, followed by whatever we 
want the return value to be.
We don't need to use the return keyword with lambdas.
Whatever is placed after the colon will be returned automatically.
The Function body of a lambda expression is only allowed to be one 
statement long.
We can do an if else statement in a lambda expression, but we can use
a turnary operator.
