Reducing
What reduce allows us to do is take a list or any other iterable and reduce it down
to a single value.

Example: we could take a list of numbers and reduce them down to a sum/average.
What reduce does is it starts with the first element in the list and builds on
this initial value in some way until after we've processed all of our elements 
we end up with the result

Reduce takes a function and an iterable as arugments.

Reduce must be imported from the functools library
