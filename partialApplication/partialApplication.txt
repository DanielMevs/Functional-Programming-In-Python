Partial Application
When we take a function that has some number of arguments, and we fix some of those
arguments to a set value.
We then return a function that has less arguments than the original.

def add(x, y, z):
	return x + y + z
        |
        |
        V
def add5(y, z):
	return 5 + y + z
		|
		|
		V
def add5( 6, 7) #->18

This function with fixed arguments can then be called from anywhere else in the code
and it will be as if we had called the original function with all of its arguments.

Partial application is a very useful way to configure more general functions into more
specific ones.
L>If there is a function that we use often in our code where one or more of the arguments
that we call it with is almost always the same, then this function is a good candidate for
using partial application.
